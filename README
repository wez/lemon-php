This is an adaptation of lemon that optionally emits PHP code to implement a
parser for the grammar described in a .y file.

Usage:

 cc -o lemon lemon.c
 lemon -lPHP my.y

This will output my.php, which contains a PHP class that implements your parser.
Usage is along the lines of:

$P = new ParseParser();
$S = new Yylex(); // you can get one of these using the JLexPHP package

while ($t = $S->yylex()) {
	$P->Parse($t->type, $t);
}
$P->Parse(0);
